## Cinnamon Theme

Cinnamon is my personal theme on Windows 11 — fast, instant, and clean. It keeps everything simple, smooth, and easy to use every day. I built it to feel focused, modern, and distraction-free while working or just chilling on my PC.

## System Configuration

To run Cinnamon smoothly and keep everything fast, instant, and clean, here is the recommended PC configuration:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| CPU | Intel Core i5 (10th gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 5 or equivalent |
| RAM | 16GB DDR4 (8GB minimum, 16GB recommended) |
| GPU | Integrated graphics is fine / Dedicated GPU optional |

---

## Hardware Requirement Notice

Some features of Cinnamon require stronger hardware to work properly.

### Required for Full Experience

The following tools **require a dedicated GPU and minimum 16GB RAM**:

- **Files 4.0**
- **tacky-border**

These tools use modern UI effects, transparency, blur, and border rendering that depend on GPU acceleration.  
Without a dedicated GPU, animations and effects may lag or behave inconsistently.

---

## Minimum for Core Usage

If you only use:

- Zen Browser  
- Zed Editor  
- GlazeWM  
- Flow Launcher  

Then:

- 8GB RAM works  
- Integrated graphics is acceptable  

But for the full Cinnamon experience (visual effects + smooth animations)

> 🎯 Dedicated GPU + 16GB RAM is required.
